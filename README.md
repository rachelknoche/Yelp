# Project 3 - *Yelp*

**Yelp** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [ ] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [ ] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Search results page
   - [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
   - [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Source Control
2. Navigation Bars

## Notes

    I know this is not an acceptable submission, but somehow in the past couple hours I managed to back myself up to barely past where I started, but I now can't even get anything to show on the simulator. I tried to use the source control inside of xcode as opposed to connecting it with github and that was a bad decision because I must have done it the wrong way. I will try to work on this app and get it to some sort of working order, but I have hit the point where it is not possible with the time I have remaining.
